---

In one of my previous posts, I have presented [how to install NAPALM and Salt](https://mirceaulinic.net/2017-03-14-install-saltstack/). While Salt can be installed directly from the [SaltStack Repo](https://repo.saltstack.com/), very easy, using [Salt Bootstrap](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/salt_bootstrap.html), NAPALM requires more steps and there are a few [system dependencies](http://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/index.html#dependencies) you may need to consider. For Salt users there's an easier way to get everything installed using one simple command.

Salt Formulas
-------------

Formulas are pre-written Salt States, provided by the Salt community. There are plenty of formulas available unde the [SaltStack Formulas GitHub organization](https://github.com/saltstack-formulas). Their installation is easy, well explained in detail here: [https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html#installation). Basically all you need to do is write your pillar as specified in the formula; each formula has also a ``pillar.example`` file to help with a structure example for the pillar.

For NAPALM users, there's a new Salt formula: [napalm-install-formula](https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/napalm-install-formula). Using this formula, we can install the system packages very easily, in addition to the ``PyPi`` requirements for the NAPALM drivers. This is also a great way to keep your environment updated, by executing a command as simple as ``salt-call state.sls napalm_install`` (I will explain below).

Regular minions and proxy minions
---------------------------------

The major difference between regular minions and proxy minions is that the latter are just one process (per network device managed), able to run from everywhere, as long as they are able to contact the Salt master. To use the ``napalm-install-formula``, you need to run the ``salt-minion`` on the same machine where you have the proxy minion(s), connected eventually to the same Salt master. This does not bring an extra dependency, the ``salt-proxy`` binary is anyway included in the ``salt-minion`` package; in other words, to be able to run proxy minions, you have already installed the ``salt-minion``, but it might not be used.

We will need to start the Salt minion, as this is the process managing our server, while the proxy minions manage our network devices.

Configure and start the ``salt-minion``
---------------------------------------

The regular minion is very simple to be started, less complicated than the proxy:

- Specify the host of the Salt master in the minion configuration file (typically ``/etc/salt/minion`` or ``/srv/minion``), under the configuration field ``master``. In this example, my minion connects to the Salt master running on the same host (in my lab, I run the proxy minions on the same physical machine as the master):

```yaml
master: localhost
```

- Start the minion process:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start salt-minion
```

- Check the unaccepted keys:

```bash
$ sudo salt-key -L
Accepted Keys:
csr1
device1
device2
nxos-spine1
vmx1
Denied Keys:
Unaccepted Keys:
eos
ip-172-31-11-15
Rejected Keys:
```

We can notice that the minion ``ip-172-31-11-15`` is not accepted yet by the master. Accept the key: ``$ sudo salt-key -a ip-172-31-11-15``.

In the following examples, ``ip-172-31-11-15`` is the minion ID of the Salt minion that manages the server where the proxies run.

Configure the ``napalm-install-formula``
----------------------------------------

- The pillar has the following structure:

``/etc/salt/pillar/napalm.sls``
```yaml
napalm:
  install:
    - napalm-iosxr
    - napalm-junos
```

Where we can list the NAPALM drivers we need. To install the complete library, with all the possible drivers, you can simply list ``napalm``.

- Map the ``napalm.sls`` pillar defined above to the Salt regular minion, idendified by its ID:

``/etc/salt/pillar/top.sls``
```yaml
base:
  'ip-172-31-11-15':
    - napalm
```

- Refresh pillar on the local minion:

```bash
$ sudo salt-call saltutil.refresh_pillar
local:
    True
```

The previous command is executed from the Salt minion server. When executing from the master side, the equivalent command is: ``$ sudo salt 'ip-172-31-11-15' saltutil.refresh_pillar``.

- Check that the minion has the right data:

```yaml
$ sudo salt-call pillar.get napalm:install
local:
    - napalm-junos
    - napalm-iosxr
```

- If you have installed the ``napalm-install-formula`` correctly, you should be able to execute: ```$ sudo salt-call state.show_sls napalm_install```. Otherwise, make sure you have the [map.jinja](https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/napalm-install-formula/blob/master/napalm_install/map.jinja) and [init.sls](https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/napalm-install-formula/blob/master/napalm_install/init.sls) in a directory called ``napalm_install``, under one of the paths listed as [``file_roots``](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#file-roots) in the master configuration.

- Execute a dry run and check the output (this step is not mandatory, but it is a good practice):

```bash
$ sudo salt-call state.sls napalm_install test=True

The test mode tells us that there are several system packages to be installed, including ``libxslt1-dev``, ``libssl-dev`` together with the NAPALM libraries from PyPi, using ``pip``. As everything looks good, we can go ahead and install:

```bash

The state execution correctly setup the environment for NAPALM and upgraded the system dependencies to the latest releases.

From here on, if we need to install another NAPALM driver, but we are unsure about its dependencies, we can simply append it to the install list (in the ``napalm.sls`` pillar), e.g.:

```yaml
napalm:
  install:
    - napalm-junos
    - napalm-iosxr
    - napalm-panos
```

Then execute the state:

```bash
$ sudo salt-call state.sls napalm_install
local:

If you are running a large scale network and your proxy minions are distributed across multiple servers, the dependencies installation becomes very stright forward:

```bash
$ sudo salt -N proxy-minions-servers state.sls napalm_install
```

Where ``proxy-minions-servers`` is a [node group](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/targeting/nodegroups.html) defined on the master, selecting the servers running the proxy processes.

Ensure you are running the latest versions
------------------------------------------

Using the [Salt schedule](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/jobs/) subsystem, we can ensure the environment is always up to date, by scheduling the state to be executed at specific intervals. For example, the following minion configuration schedules the ``napalm_install`` state to be executed every Monday, at 10AM:

```yaml
schedule:
  napalm_env:
    function: state.sls
    arg:
      - napalm_install
    when:
      - Monday 10:00am
```

Conclusions
-----------

Although there are some additional steps to get the formula up and running, on the long run this method will turn to be very handy and a good way to maintain your environment updated. In the NAPALM community, we have agreed to release bugfixes and feature releases as often as possible, so most of the time upgrading to the latest version will probably help. So why not use the [Salt schedule](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/jobs/) to execute the ``napalm_install`` state periodically and ensure your environment is always running the latest versions.
